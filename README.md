### models Folder
The models folder contains all the data models used within the Flutter application. These models represent the structure of the data that the application works with. This folder is essential for maintaining a clean architecture by separating data representations from business logic and UI.

#### Purpose
The main purpose of the `models` folder is to:
1. Define the structure of data objects.
2. Handle data serialization and deserialization.
3. Ensure type safety within the application.

#### Typical Contents
The `models` folder typically contains:
- Dart classes representing different data entities.
- Utility methods for data manipulation and validation.

### Song Model

The `Song` class is a data model that represents a song in the Flutter application. This class is used to define the structure of a song object, including its title, artist, album, cover art, and file path.

#### Purpose
The `Song` class is designed to:
1. Provide a structured way to represent song data.
2. Facilitate the handling of song metadata within the application.
3. Ensure type safety for song-related data.
